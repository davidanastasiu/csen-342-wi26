    "\n",
    "**Course:** CSEN 342: Deep Learning  \n",
    "**Topic:** Decoder Transformers, Autoregressive Generation, Sampling Strategies, and Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "While BERT is a master of *understanding* (classification, NER), models like **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** are masters of *creation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT is a **Decoder-only** architecture. It is trained to predict the next token in a sequence given all previous tokens. This simple objective allows it to generate coherent essays, code, and stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "1.  **Load GPT-2:** A smaller predecessor to the famous GPT-3/4, but conceptually identical.\n",
    "2.  **Implement the Generation Loop:** Manually write the code to generate text token-by-token.\n",
    "3.  **Compare Decoding Strategies:** Implement Greedy Search, Beam Search, and Top-K Sampling to see how they affect creativity.\n",
    "4.  **Prompt Engineering:** Use \"Few-Shot\" prompting to make the model solve logic puzzles without fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Run this notebook under the `Transformers Bundle` kernel instead of the class kernel.\n",
